# Supply Chain and Data Management

## Project: CRM Analysis

This project focuses on Customer Relationship Management (CRM) analysis, where data on customer interactions is analyzed to provide insights into customer behavior, preferences, and feedback. This analysis is critical for understanding customer needs and optimizing engagement strategies.

### Dataset
- [CRM Dataset on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Iesv1Y7DVdv6Z4Oq8IwJ99_gMSEFecDk?usp=sharing)

### Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Outlier Management**: Identify and address any outliers that could skew the results.
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Replace or remove missing data as appropriate.
   - **Duplicate Management**: Detect and remove any duplicate entries.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Explore data patterns and relationships to understand customer behaviors and transaction patterns.

3. **Customer-Centric Feature Engineering**:
   - **RFM Analysis**: Calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values for customer segmentation.
   - **Additional Features**: Include metrics like average days between purchases, preferred shopping days, and peak shopping hours.

### Goal
The objective is to derive insights into customer behavior, including segmenting customers based on their activity levels and understanding patterns that can help the business tailor its CRM strategies.
